# Automate_SMS
A brief Python script to automate your messaging

I found myself needing to send numerous SMS messages to various users, each with a unique numerical code. I've included a sample Excel database for a quick preview of the simplicity I aimed for. If you encounter a similar challenge, feel free to use my code as a starting point and customize it to suit your needs. I would be delighted if my code proves helpful :)
